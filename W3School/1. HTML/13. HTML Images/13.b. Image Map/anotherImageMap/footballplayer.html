    <h1>Football Player</h1>
    <p><img src="footballplayer.jpg" alt="footballPlayer">A football player or footballer is a sportsperson who plays one of the different types of football. The main types of football are association football, American football, Canadian football, Australian rules football, Gaelic football, rugby league, and rugby union.

It has been estimated that there are 250 million association football players in the world,[1] and many play other forms of football.

Career
Jean-Pierre Papin has described football as a "universal language".[2] Footballers across the world and at almost any level may regularly attract large crowds of spectators, and players are the focal points of widespread social phenomena such as association football culture.

Footballers usually begin as amateurs and the best players progress to become professional players. Normally they start at a youth team (any local team) and from there, based on skill and talent, scouts offer contracts. Once signed, some learn to play better football and a few advance to the senior or professional teams.

Pay
Pay in some top men's leagues is significantly higher than in other jobs. Players in the Premier League earn an average of $3 million per year.[3] In the wealthiest clubs in European football leagues, men earn an average $7.19 million per year.[4] The best players of those clubs can earn up to $260 million per year.[5]

However, only a fraction of men's professional football players are paid at this level. Wages may be somewhat more moderate in other divisions and leagues. For example, the average annual salary for footballers in Major League Soccer (MLS) is $530,262 as of May 2023.[6]

Average salaries in women's leagues are far lower. For example, players in the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL), which started in 2012, earn an average of $54,000 per year as of May 2022.[7] For the first time in 2022, the NWSL guaranteed players a living wage. The minimum salary in 2023 is $36,400 to ensure players do not need second or third jobs to survive.[8]

A minority of retired footballers continue working full-time in football, for instance as football managers. A 1979 study reported that former first-team ballplayers were over-represented as top-ranking executives in their companies and had greater income mobility than second-teamers and reserves.[9] However, some experience chronic health issues, see below.

Skills and specialties
Association football specialties (positions)

Special purpose positions include such performers as sweepers, stoppers, second forwards (under-attackers), wingers, insiders, etc.

Goalkeepers: good reflexes, communication with defence, one-on-one ability, command of the penalty area and aerial intelligence.[10]
Centre-backs: good heading and tackling ability, height, bravery in attempting challenges, and concentration.[11]

Psychological aspects of performance
Research shows that association football players who take less than 200 milliseconds after the referee blows their whistle to make a penalty kick are significantly less likely to score than those who take over a second.[16][17]</p>
