      A football or soccer ball is the ball used in the sport of association
      football. The ball's spherical shape, as well as its size, mass, and
      material composition, are specified by Law 2 of the Laws of the Game
      maintained by the International Football Association Board.[1] Additional,
      more stringent standards are specified by FIFA and other big governing
      bodies for the balls used in the competitions they sanction. Early
      footballs began as animal bladders or stomachs that would easily fall
      apart if kicked too much. Improvements became possible in the 19th century
      with the introduction of rubber and discoveries of vulcanization by
      Charles Goodyear. The modern 32-panel ball design was developed in 1962 by
      Eigil Nielsen, and technological research continues to develop footballs
      with improved performance. The 32-panel ball design was soon joined by
      24-panel balls as well as 42-panel balls, both of which improved on
      performance prior to 2007.[citation needed] A black-and-white patterned
      spherical truncated icosahedron design, brought to prominence by the
      Adidas Telstar, has become a symbol of association football.[2] Many
      different designs of balls exist, varying both in appearance and physical
      characteristics.[3] History First years of football codes In the year
      1863, the first specifications for footballs were set by the Football
      Association. Previous to this, footballs were made out of inflated animal
      bladder, with later leather coverings to help footballs maintain their
      shapes and sizes.[4] In 1872, the specifications were revised and have
      been kept essentially unchanged by the International Football Association
      Board. Differences in footballs made since this rule came into effect have
      been with the material used to create them. Footballs have dramatically
      changed over time. During medieval times balls were normally made from an
      outer shell of leather filled with cork shavings.[5] Another method of
      creating a ball was using animal bladders to make it inflatable inside.
      However, these two styles of footballs were easy to puncture and were
      inadequate for kicking. It was not until the 19th century that footballs
      developed a more modern appearance. Vulcanization In 1838, Charles
      Goodyear introduced vulcanized rubber, which dramatically improved
      football.[6] Vulcanization is the treatment of rubber to give it certain
      qualities such as strength, elasticity, and resistance to solvents.
      Vulcanization of rubber also helps the football resist moderate heat and
      cold. Vulcanization helped create inflatable bladders that pressurize the
      outer panel arrangement of the football. Charles Goodyear's innovation
      increased the bounce ability of the ball and made it easier to kick. Most
      balls of this time had tanned leather with eighteen sections stitched
      together. These were arranged in six panels of three strips each.[7][8]
      Reasons for improvement During the 1900s, footballs were made of leather,
      with a lace of the same material (known as tiento in Spanish) used to
      stitch the panels. While leather was ideal for bouncing and kicking the
      ball, heading the football (hitting it with the player's head) was often
      painful. This discomfort was likely due to the leather absorbing water
      from rain, which significantly increased the ball's mass and led to head
      or neck injuries. By around 2017, this had also been associated with
      dementia in former players.[9] Another problem of early footballs was that
      they deteriorated quickly, as the plastic used in manufacturing varied in
      thickness and in quality.[7] The ball without the leather lace was
      developed and patented by Romano Polo, Antonio Tossolini and Juan
      Valbonesi in 1931 in Bell Ville, CÃ³rdoba Province, Argentina.[10][11] This
      innovative ball (named Superball) was adopted by the Argentine Football
      Association as the official ball for its competitions in 1932.[12] Latest
      developments The deformation of the football when it is kicked or when the
      ball hits a surface is tested. Two styles of footballs have been tested by
      the Sports Technology Research Group of Wolfson School of Mechanical and
      Manufacturing Engineering in Loughborough University; these two models are
      called the Basic FE model and the Developed FE model of the football. The
      basic model considered the ball as a spherical shell with isotropic
      material properties. The developed model also used isotropic material
      properties but included an additional stiffer stitching seam region.
      Manufacturers are experimenting with microchips and even cameras embedded
      inside the ball. The microchip technology was considered for the goal-line
      technology. The ball used in the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia had an
      embedded chip which did not provide any measurements, but provided 'user
      experience' via smartphone after connecting with the ball via
      NFC.[13][14][15] Future developments Companies such as Umbro, Mitre,
      Adidas, Nike, Select and Puma are releasing footballs made out of new
      materials which are intended to provide more accurate flight and more
      power to be transferred to the football.[16][17]
