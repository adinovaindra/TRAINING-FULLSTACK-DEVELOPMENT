      <img src="laptop.jpg" alt="Laptop" />A laptop computer or notebook
      computer, also known as a laptop or notebook, is a small, portable
      personal computer (PC). Laptops typically have a clamshell form factor
      with a flat-panel screen on the inside of the upper lid and an
      alphanumeric keyboard and pointing device on the inside of the lower
      lid.[1][2] Most of the computer's internal hardware is in the lower part,
      under the keyboard, although many modern laptops have a built-in webcam at
      the top of the screen, and some even feature a touchscreen display. In
      most cases, unlike tablet computers which run on mobile operating systems,
      laptops tend to run on desktop operating systems, which were originally
      developed for desktop computers.
