    <h1>Coffee</h1>

      <img src="coffee.jpg" alt="Coffee" />Coffee is a beverage brewed from
      roasted, ground coffee beans. Darkly colored, bitter, and slightly acidic,
      coffee has a stimulating effect on humans, primarily due to its caffeine
      content, but decaffeinated coffee is also commercially available. There
      are also various coffee substitutes. Coffee production begins when the
      seeds from coffee cherries (the Coffea plant's fruits) are separated to
      produce unroasted green coffee beans. The "beans" are roasted and then
      ground into fine particles. Coffee is brewed from the ground roasted
      beans, which are typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out.
      It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common.
      Coffee can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso,
      French press, caff√® latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). Sugar, sugar
      substitutes, milk, and cream are often added to mask the bitter taste or
      enhance the flavor. Though coffee is now a global commodity, it has a long
      history tied closely to food traditions around the Red Sea. Credible
      evidence of coffee drinking as the modern beverage subsequently appears in
      modern-day Yemen in southern Arabia in the middle of the 15th century in
      Sufi shrines, where coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a manner
      similar to how it is now prepared for drinking.[4] The coffee beans were
      procured by the Yemenis from the Ethiopian Highlands via coastal Somali
      intermediaries, and cultivated in Yemen. By the 16th century, the drink
      had reached the rest of the Middle East and North Africa, later spreading
      to Europe. The two most commonly grown coffee bean types are C. arabica
      and C. robusta.[5] Coffee plants are cultivated in over 70 countries,
      primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, the
      Indian subcontinent, and Africa. Green, unroasted coffee is traded as an
      agricultural commodity. The global coffee industry is worth $495.50
      billion, as of 2023.[6] In 2023, Brazil was the leading grower of coffee
      beans, producing 31% of the world's total, followed by Vietnam. While
      coffee sales reach billions of dollars annually worldwide, coffee farmers
      disproportionately live in poverty. Critics of the coffee industry have
      also pointed to its negative impact on the environment and the clearing of
      land for coffee-growing and water use.
